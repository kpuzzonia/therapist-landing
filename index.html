            <h2>Hi, I’m Renee.</h2>
            <p>I became a therapist because I know what it feels like to hold everything together on the outside while quietly falling apart on the inside. I work with women who are exhausted from overgiving, overthinking, and putting themselves last - and I help them find their way back to themselves.</p><br>
            <p>My approach is warm, grounded, and collaborative. I don't believe in one-size-fits-all therapy. Together we'll move at a pace that feels right for you, using evidence-based tools that actually fit your real life.</p><br>
            <p>I hold a Master's in Counseling Psychology and am a Licensed Professional Counselor in the state of Michigan. I offer both in-person and telehealth sessions.</p><br>

            <h3>Anxiety &<br> Overwhelm</h3>
            <p>You're capable and accomplished - so why does everything still feel like too much? We'll work to quiet the noise, calm your nervous system, and help you feel steady again.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="specialities-div">
            <h3>Burnout &<br> Life Transitions</h3>
            <p>Career changes, new motherhood, loss, identity shifts - life transitions can leave you feeling unrecognizable to yourself. Therapy can help you find solid ground.</p>

        <div class="specialities-div">
            <h3>People Pleasing &<br> Boundaries</h3>
            <p>If you've spent years saying yes when you mean no, we'll work together to understand why - and help you build relationships that actually feel reciprocal.</p>

            <p>Fill out the contact form or send me an email. I'll get back to you within 48 hours to schedule a free 15-minute consultation call.</p>
            <h3>Step 2 - Free Consultation</h3>
            <p>We'll spend 15 minutes getting to know each other. You can ask questions, share what's bringing you to therapy, and get a feel for whether we're a good fit.</p>
            <h3>Step 3 - Begin Your Work</h3>
            <p> If we decide to move forward, we'll schedule your first full session. Most clients meet weekly, though we'll find a rhythm that works for your life.</p>
